Title: Simply Caching R Objects
Description: Provides intuitive functions for caching R objects, encouraging
	reproducible, restartable, and distributed R analysis. The user selects a
	location to store caches, and then provides  nothing more than a cache name
	and instructions (R code) for how to produce the R object. simpleCache also
	provides some advanced options like environment assignments, recreating or
	reloading caches, and cluster compute bindings (using the 'batchtools'
	package) making it flexible enough for use in large-scale data analysis
	projects.
